* Gem game flow:
* 0. Generate board
* 1. Click two pieces.
* 2. If adjacent, continue. Otherwise, wait for 1.
* 3. If k>=3 of same color adjacent vertically or horizontally, continue. Otherwise, do not swap, wait for 1.
* 4. Kill k pieces, compute new vertical or horizontal pieces to fill at top of columns in model. Spawn appropriate unit
* counts given the number of pieces killed by placing them into the unit queue.
* 5. Kill k divs, generate new divs, run animation events, register animation on-complete events.
* 6. On animation complete, go to 3 to check the new board.
*
* Tug of war game flow:
* 0. Clear game board
* 1. On each timestep:
* 2. Place queue units into empty spots on game board and empty the queue, if possible.
* 3. For each piece:
* 4. Is a complementary, enemy, unevaluated piece sharing the same row, a row above or a row below? If so, continue.
* Otherwise, skip to 6.
* 5. If so, mark both pieces to be killed. If it's the same row, mark the pieces to be animated with horizontal movement
* towards the midpoint. If +/-1 row, calculate a move towards a "half row."
* 6. If not complementary, enemy, unevaluated piece sharing rows i-1 to i+1, mark the piece to be animated moving in the
* opponent's direction.
* 7. If all pieces are evaluated, continue. Otherwise, go back to 3.
* 8. Execute animations and update states. Go back to 1.
